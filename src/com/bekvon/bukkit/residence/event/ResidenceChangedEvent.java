/**
 * The {@link ResidenceChangedEvent} is fired when a player transitions between residences and/or
 * residence subzones. Possible transitions include:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Moving from no residence into a residence/subzone;</li>
 * <li>Moving from a residence/subzone to no residence; or</li>
 * <li>Moving between residences/subzones</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * {@link ResidenceChangedEvent} is a replacement for {@link ResidenceEnterEvent} and
 * {@link ResidenceLeaveEvent}, which have been marked as deprecated and will be removed in future
 * releases. Using this event benefits developers as it encapsulates enter/leave conditions in a
 * single event and doesn't require additional correlation to detect and residence-to-residence
 * transition.
 * <p/>
 * <p>
 * This event is fired whenever conditions are met when a player moves or teleports to a new
 * location. The event is also triggered when players appear in a residence upon logging in.
